-- Combination of grouping, sampling and permutation.
--   We group the companies by industry grouping code,
--   sample at most 10 elements from each group,
--   then permute the tuples in each group to select
--   only the symbol.
--
--   This demonstrates that we can lift per-group operators
--   to our produced groups.
